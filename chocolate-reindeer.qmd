Drawn to the allure of the Chocolate Reindeer, Hannah and Meghan eagerly selected one each. As they took a bite, a wave of enchantment coursed through the girls, and they felt the chocolate stall slowly start to spin.

Wizzle gazed in wonder as Hannah's coat began to transform into a deer's tawny fur. A pair of majestic antler's sprouted from Meghan's forehead, her legs grew longer while her shoes and gloves transformed into black shiny hooves. 

Before the chocolate treat was finished, the two girls stood eight feet tall, magically transformed into a pair of majestic reindeer, complete with velvety antlers.

"Oh deer, oh deer, oh deer", muttered Wizzle, "this isn't supposed to happen!". 

Hannah and Meghan trotted lightly into the Christmas Market, enjoying the fresh feeling of snow under their hooves. 

"Come back!" called Wizzle, but the girls were too excited to hear. Gathering speed from a trot to a canter, Hannah and Meghan felt the rush of weightlessness beneath them and with a joyous leap the two rein-girls soared into the sky.

Flying high above the market Hannah and Meghan could see the whole night-time forest spread out below. In a clearing in the woods they saw a group of snowmen playfully throwing snowballs. Each snowball sparkled with a different color, creating a dazzling display of winter magic.

Hannah suddenly noticed something strange flying up ahead. An elf sped through the air on a little red bicycle, leaving behind a trail of sparkles and jingling laughter.
