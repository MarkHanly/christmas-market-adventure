Santa's workshop was nestled in a clearing deep within the night-time forest. As Hannah, Meghan and Jingleberry approached they could hear the rhythmic sound of hammers and cheerful singing. 

Home at last! cried Jingleberry happily. But his smile did not last long.

At the entrance of the workshop, they were welcomed by Mrs. Claus, who wore a worried expression. "Oh, hello dears! Have you seen Santa by any chance? It's Christmas eve and he's nowhere to be found, I'm starting to get a little nervous."

Hannah and Meghan exchanged worried glances. "We could go back and search the night-time forest on foot?", suggested Jingleberry. 

Or... said Mrs Claus thoughtfully looking towards the lamp-lit stable, there's always Tipsycake?
