Hannah and Meghan couldn't resist the charm of the Giggle Gumdrops, and with a cheerful nod, they tried a handful each. As soon as they tasted the magical treats, their giggles echoed through the market, and the sisters began to float in the air, surrounded by a group of flying gingerbread cookies.

Giggling and floating, Hannah and Meghan reached the end of the market where they saw two intriguing paths.

Straight ahead, a candy cane bridge led to a mysterious forest. To the left, a jingle bell path twinkled with festive lights.
