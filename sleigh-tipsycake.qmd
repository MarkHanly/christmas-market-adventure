As Tipsycake descended from the starry sky, Hannah and Meghan spotted Santa's sleigh nestled among the snow-covered trees of the night-time forest. The once-majestic sleigh, adorned with festive lights and laden with presents, was buried deep in tangle of briars.

As the girls approached with Jingleberry, Santa greeted them with a hearty "Ho, ho, ho! My dear friends, it seems I've hit a bit of a hiccup in my journey. The sleigh's harness got tangled in some flying gingerbread and we crashed into the snow."

"But where are the reindeer, Santa?" asked Jingleberry. 

"Prancer pranced off into the forest, and Dasher dashed after him" grumbled Santa. "Now they've all run off".

"Fear not, Santa! We're here to lend a hand" said Jingleberry, and with a merry whistle he summoned Tipsycake. 

Tipsycake approached the fallen sleigh with a gently whiny and a shake of her tinsel-mane. Her horn emitted a soft glow as she carefully untangled the branches, each touch restoring a bit of the sleigh's magic. 

"Oh oh oh! Thank you Tipsycake!" cried Santa in delight. 

Hannah and Meghan helped Jingleberry to harness Tipsycake to the sleigh while Santa picked up the presents that lay scattered in the snow. 

Soon they were ready to take to the skies on the most magical journey of the year.
