The once-majestic sleigh, adorned with fairylights and laden with presents, was buried deep in tangle of briars.\n\nAs the girls approached with Jingleberry, Santa greeted them with a hearty \"Ho, ho, ho! My dear friends, it seems I've hit a bit of a hiccup in my journey. The sleigh's harness got tangled in some flying gingerbread and we crashed into the snow.\"\n\n\"But where are the reindeer, Santa?\" asked Jingleberry. \n\n\"Prancer dashed off into the forest, and Dasher pranced after him\" grumbled Santa. \"Now they've all run off\".\n\n\"Fear not, Santa! We're here to lend a hand\" said Jingleberry, and with a merry whistle he summoned Tipsycake. \n\nTipsycake approached the fallen sleigh with a gently whiny and a shake of her tinsel-mane. Her horn emitted a soft glow as she carefully untangled the branches, each touch restoring a bit of the sleigh's magic. \n\n\"Oh oh oh! Thank you Tipsycake!\" cried Santa in delight. \n\nHannah and Meghan helped Jingleberry to harness Tipsycake to the sleigh while Santa picked up the presents that lay scattered in the snow. \n\nSoon they were ready to take to the skies on the most magical journey of the year. \n\n::::\n\n:::: {.column-body .scenario-image}\n::: {style=\"text-align: center;\"}\n### What will you choose?\n:::\n\n\n  ```{=html}\n<div class=\"container\">\n\n  <div id=\"back\">\n  <img src=\"images/back.png\" alt=\"Go back\" style=\"width: 100px; height: 100px; margin-right: 10px;\">Go back\n  </div>\n  \n  <div class=\"final-options\">\n  \n  <div class=\"option\">\n  <a href=\"flying-home.html\"><img src=\"images/harness-tipsycake.png\" alt=\"Click here to ride the sleigh with Tipsycake\"<div>Click here to ride the sleigh with Tipsycake</div></a>\n  </div>\n  \n  </div>\n  ```\n\n\n::::\n\n\n\n\n::::::\n",
