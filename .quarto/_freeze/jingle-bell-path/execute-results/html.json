The sound of their footsteps mixed with the cheerful jingling of bells. \n\nAs the sisters wandered deeper into the night-time forest, they started to notice a more and more snowmen on either side of the path. Suddenly, the snowmen came to life, pelting Hannah and Meghan with snowballs. The girls giggled as they tried to dodge the frosty onslaught, but they soon found themselves surrounded.\n\nJust as the sisters were about to be covered in a snowy blanket, a voice rang out, \"Hold on there, frosty fellows! That's no way to treat our friends.\"\n\nHannah and Meghan turned to see a lively elf with a jingling hat and a satchel of jingle berries. It was Jingleberry, the cheerful guardian of the Jingle Bell Path.\n\nWith a swift wave of his jingling wand, Jingleberry cast a spell that made the snowmen break into laughter instead of launching snowballs. They danced and jingled around, transforming the icy battlefield into a winter wonderland of joy.\n\n\"Phew, that was close! Thanks for saving us, Jingleberry,\" Hannah exclaimed, grateful for her new elf friend.\n\nJingleberry grinned, \"No problem at all! Us elves stick together, especially during the most jingling time of the year. \n\n\"Where will this path take us, Jingleberry?\" asked Meghan.\n\nWhy this is the way to Santa's workshop, silly goose! teased Jingleberry. Just keep following that path. Unless you want to have a go on my Jinglebike first he offered? \n\n::::\n\n:::: {.column-body .scenario-image}\n::: {style=\"text-align: center;\"}\n### What will you choose?\n:::\n\n\n\n  ```{=html}\n<div class=\"container\">\n\n  <div id=\"back\">\n  <img src=\"images/back.png\" alt=\"Go back\" style=\"width: 100px; height: 100px; margin-right: 10px;\">Go back\n  </div>\n  \n  <div class=\"options\">\n  <div class=\"option\">\n  <a href=\"santas-workshop.html\"><img src=\"images/santas-workshop.png\" alt=\"Search for Santa's workshop\"><div>Search for Santa's workshop</div></a>\n  </div>\n  \n  <div class=\"option\">\n  <a href=\"jinglebike2.html\"><img src=\"images/jinglebike.png\" alt=\"Take the jinglebike for a spin\"><div>Take the jinglebike for a spin</div></a>\n  </div>\n  \n  </div>\n  ```\n\n\n\n::::\n\n\n\n\n::::::\n",
