I'm sure Tipsycake will help you find Santa. \nAs they entered, they were greeted by the warm glow of a turf fire. In the midst of this cozy atmosphere, the girls eyes widened with wonder as she spotted a majestic unicorn resting calmly on a bed of ribbons and holly. \n\nTipsycake's fur shimmered like freshly fallen snow and her mane sparkled with tinsel. Around her neck hung a Christmas wreath braided with lanterns and bells. \n\nSensing adventure in the air, the unicorn stood to her full height and trotted out of the warm stable into the snow-filled yard. Don't be naughty Jingleberry, pleaded Mrs Claus as she helped the elf onto Tipsycake's back. And remember to be nice, she added, lifting the two girls up behind the elf. \n\nWith a gallop of hooves and a golden spark, Hannah, Meghan and Jingleberry rose into the starry sky. Soon they were high above the night-time forest, scanning the trees below for the lights of Santa's sleigh. \n\n\n::::\n\n:::: {.column-body .scenario-image}\n::: {style=\"text-align: center;\"}\n### What will you choose?\n:::\n\n\n  ```{=html}\n<div class=\"container\">\n\n  <div id=\"back\">\n  <img src=\"images/back.png\" alt=\"Go back\" style=\"width: 100px; height: 100px; margin-right: 10px;\">Go back\n  </div>\n  \n  <div class=\"final-options\">\n  <div class=\"option\">\n  <a href=\"sleigh-tipsycake.html\"><img src=\"images/sleigh.png\" alt=\"Santa's sleigh\"><div>Santa's sleigh</div></a>\n  </div>\n  \n  </div>\n  ```\n\n\n::::\n\n\n\n\n::::::\n",
