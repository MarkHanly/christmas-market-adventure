As they took a bite, a wave of enchantment coursed through the girls, and they felt the chocolate stall slowly start to spin.\n\nWizzle gazed in wonder as Hannah's coat began to transform into a deer's tawny fur. A pair of majestic antler's sprouted from Meghan's forehead, her legs grew longer while her shoes and gloves transformed into black shiny hooves. \n\nBefore the chocolate treat was finished, the two girls stood eight feet tall, magically transformed into a pair of majestic reindeer, complete with velvety antlers.\n\n\"Oh deer, oh deer, oh deer\", muttered Wizzle, \"this isn't supposed to happen!\". \n\nHannah and Meghan trotted lightly into the Christmas Market, enjoying the fresh feeling of snow under their hooves. \n\n\"Come back!\" called Wizzle, but the girls were too excited to hear. Gathering speed from a trot to a canter, Hannah and Meghan felt the rush of weightlessness beneath them and with a joyous leap the two rein-girls soared into the sky.\n\nFlying high above the market Hannah and Meghan could see the whole night-time forest spread out below. In a clearing in the woods they saw a group of snowmen playfully throwing snowballs. Each snowball sparkled with a different color, creating a dazzling display of winter magic.\n\nHannah suddenly noticed something strange flying up ahead. An elf sped through the air on a little red bicycle, leaving behind a trail of sparkles and jingling laughter. \n\n::::\n\n:::: {.column-body .scenario-image}\n::: {style=\"text-align: center;\"}\n### What will you choose?\n:::\n\n\n  ```{=html}\n<div class=\"container\">\n\n  <div id=\"back\">\n  <img src=\"images/back.png\" alt=\"Go back\" style=\"width: 100px; height: 100px; margin-right: 10px;\">Go back\n  </div>\n  \n  <div class=\"options\">\n  \n  <div class=\"option\">\n  <a href=\"snowmen-reindeer.html\"><img src=\"images/snowmen.png\" alt=\"The Snowmen\"><div>The Snowmen</div></a>\n  </div>\n  \n  <div class=\"option\">\n    <a href=\"jinglebike-crash.html\"><img src=\"images/jingleberry-bike.png\" alt=\"Follow the bike\"><div>Follow the bike</div></a>\n      </div>\n\n  \n  </div>\n  ```\n\n\n::::\n\n\n\n\n::::::\n",
