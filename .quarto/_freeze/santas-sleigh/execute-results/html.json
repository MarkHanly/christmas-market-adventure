The once-majestic sleigh, adorned with festive lights and laden with presents, was bedded deep in tangle of briars.\n\nAs Cara and Jingleberry approached, Santa greeted them with a hearty \"Ho, ho, ho! My dear friends, it seems I've hit a bit of a hiccup in my journey. The sleigh's harness got tangled in some flying gingerebread. I could use a bit of help to get everything back in order.\"\n\n\"Fear not, Santa! We're here to lend a hand\" said Jingleberry, and with a jangling whistle he summoned Tipsycake the unicorn. \n\nTipsycake approached the fallen sleigh with a gently whiny and a shake of her tinsel-mane. Her horn emitted a soft glow as she carefully untangled the branches, each touch restoring a bit of the sleigh's magic. \n\n\"Oh oh oh! Thank you Tipsycake!\" cried Santa in delight. \n\n::::\n\n:::: {.column-body .scenario-image}\n::: {style=\"text-align: center;\"}\n### What will you choose?\n:::\n\n\n  ```{=html}\n<div class=\"container\">\n\n  <div id=\"back\">\n  <a href=\"market.html\"><img src=\"images/back.png\" alt=\"Go back\" style=\"width: 100px; height: 100px; margin-right: 10px;\"></a>Go back\n  </div>\n  \n  <div class=\"final-options\">\n  \n  <div class=\"option\">\n  <a href=\"flying-home.html\"><img src=\"images/harness-tipsycake.png\" alt=\"Harness Tipsycake\"<div>Harness Tipsycake</div></a>\n  </div>\n  \n  </div>\n  ```\n\n\n::::\n\n\n\n\n::::::\n",
