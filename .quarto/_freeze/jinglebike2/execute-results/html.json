Hannah and Meghan hopped onto the back of the jinglebike, and with a joyful giggle, Jingleberry pedaled away through the night-time forest. \n\nIt was hard work cycling through the snow and Jingleberry soon got tired. \"Let's give it a some welly, eh\", suggested Jingleberry. With a jingle of his bell and a burst of twinkling lights, they lifted off the ground.\n\nThe sisters found themselves soaring through the night sky, the forest below transformed into a dazzling display of sparkling trees and glimmering snow.      \n\nAs they giggled and floated through the sky, they spotted Santa's workshop, where cheerful elves were busy wrapping presents and preparing for the big night. The lights twinkled like a million stars, and the sound of holiday cheer filled the air.\n\nBut there was something else catching their attention. In a clearing below, they saw a group of playful snowmen having a snowball fight. Each snowball sparkled with a different color, creating a dazzling display of winter magic.\n\n::::\n\n:::: {.column-body .scenario-image}\n::: {style=\"text-align: center;\"}\n### What will you choose?\n:::\n\n\n\n  ```{=html}\n<div class=\"container\">\n\n  <div id=\"back\">\n  <img src=\"images/back.png\" alt=\"Go back\" style=\"width: 100px; height: 100px; margin-right: 10px;\">Go back\n  </div>\n  \n  <div class=\"options\">\n  <div class=\"option\">\n  <a href=\"santas-workshop.html\"><img src=\"images/santas-workshop.png\" alt=\"Santa's workshop\"><div>Santa's workshop</div></a>\n  </div>\n  \n  <div class=\"option\">\n  <a href=\"santas-workshop.html\"><img src=\"images/snowmen.png\" alt=\"The snowmen\"><div>The snowmen</div></a>\n  </div>\n\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n\n\n::::\n\n\n\n\n::::::\n",
