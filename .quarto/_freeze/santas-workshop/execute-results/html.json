As Hannah, Meghan and Jingleberry approached they could hear the rhythmic sound of hammers and cheerful singing. \n\nHome at last! cried Jingleberry happily. But his smile did not last long.\n\nAt the entrance of the workshop, they were welcomed by Mrs. Claus, who wore a worried expression. \"Oh, hello dears! Have you seen Santa by any chance? It's Christmas eve and he's nowhere to be found, I'm starting to get a little nervous.\"\n\nHannah and Meghan exchanged worried glances. \"We could go back and search the night-time forest on foot?\", suggested Jingleberry. \n\nOr... said Mrs Claus thoughtfully looking towards the lamp-lit stable, there's always Tipsycake?\n\n::::\n\n:::: {.column-body .scenario-image}\n::: {style=\"text-align: center;\"}\n### What will you choose?\n:::\n\n\n  ```{=html}\n<div class=\"container\">\n\n  <div id=\"back\">\n  <img src=\"images/back.png\" alt=\"Go back\" style=\"width: 100px; height: 100px; margin-right: 10px;\">Go back\n  </div>\n  \n  <div class=\"options\">\n  <div class=\"option\">\n  <a href=\"sleigh-on-foot.html\"><img src=\"images/night-time-forest.png\" alt=\"Go back on foot\"><div>Go back on foot</div></a>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"option\">\n  <a href=\"tipsycake.html\"><img src=\"images/stable.png\" alt=\"Go to the stable\"<div>Go to the stable</div></a>\n  </div>\n  \n  </div>\n  ```\n\n\n::::\n\n\n\n\n::::::\n",
