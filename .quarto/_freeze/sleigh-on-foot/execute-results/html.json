There was no sign of the lights from Santa's sleigh, just dark branches and the crunch of snow. \n\nThe sisters felt cold and tired and even Jingleberry had stopped jingling gaily by their side. \n\nFinally the two girls sat down in the snow, exhausted. \"I'm banjaxed\" cried Hannah \"and we're lost!\" added Meghan. Jingleberry jangled and knelt in the snow beside the girls. Using his cloak as a blanket, he wrapped it around Hannah and Meghan and the sisters soon fell asleep. \n\n\"We're lost, we're lost\" tinkled Jingleberry sadly, shivering in the snow.\n\n***\n\nHannah and Meghan awoke as a radiant glow emerged through the trees. There, against the starlit backdrop, appeared Santa Claus atop Tipsycake, his majestic Christmas unicorn.\n\nTipsycake was as white as freshly fallen snow, her mane was a glittering pink tinsel and her horn emitting an enchanting glow.  \n\n\"Ho ho ho!\" bellowed Santa Claus, \"I'm glad I've finally found you three! Come on, it's time we got you home.\"\n\n::::\n\n:::: {.column-body .scenario-image}\n::: {style=\"text-align: center;\"}\n### What will you choose?\n:::\n\n\n  ```{=html}\n<div class=\"container\">\n\n  <div id=\"back\">\n  <img src=\"images/back.png\" alt=\"Go back\" style=\"width: 100px; height: 100px; margin-right: 10px;\">Go back\n  </div>\n  \n  <div class=\"final-options\">\n  \n  <div class=\"option\">\n  <a href=\"flying-home.html\"><img src=\"images/santa-on-tipsycake.png\" alt=\"Click here to fly home with Tipsycake\"<div>Click here to fly home with Tipsycake</div></a>\n  </div>\n  \n  </div>\n  ```\n\n\n::::\n\n\n\n\n::::::\n",
