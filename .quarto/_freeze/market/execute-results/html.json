Hannah was three and Meghan was two.

The tent seemed to glow with magical energy. \n\n::::\n\n:::: {.column-body .scenario-image}\n::: {style=\"text-align: center;\"}\n### What will you choose?\n:::\n\n\n  ```{=html}\n<div class=\"container\">\n\n  <div id=\"back\">\n  <img src=\"images/back.png\" alt=\"Go back\" style=\"width: 100px; height: 100px; margin-right: 10px;\">Go back\n  </div>\n  \n  <div class=\"options\">\n  <div class=\"option\">\n  <a href=\"chocolate-stall.html\"><img src=\"images/chocolate-stall.png\" alt=\"The chocolate stall\"><div>The chocolate stall</div></a>\n  </div>\n  \n  <div class=\"option\">\n  <a href=\"madame-mistletoe.html\"><img src=\"images/fortune-teller.png\" alt=\"The fortune teller\"><div>The fortune teller</div></a>\n  </div>\n  \n  </div>\n  ```\n\n\n::::\n\n\n\n\n::::::\n",
