Hannah and Meghan cantered through the air after the merry red bicycle. The elf was clearly in a lot of trouble. Sparks and smoke billowed from the bike and the elf's jingling laughter had turned to jangling screams. 

Feeling the Chocolate Reindeer magic fade, the sisters descended to the snowy forest floor, searching for the fallen elf. Meghan found him headfirst in a snowdrift, chiming sadly, the strange bicycle broken at his feet.

"Don't cry", pleaded Hannah, feeling the soft spot on her forehead where the velvety antlers had once grown. 

"You don't understand" said the elf, whose name was Jingleberry. It's Christmas eve and I'm late for work, I need to get to Santa's workshop but my jinglebike is broken. 

"Poor little elf!" said Hannah and Meghan at the same time.
