As they approached the tent they noticed a sign that read, “Madame Mistletoe’s Magical Fortunes.”\nIntrigued, Hannah and Meghan entered the tent, where the air was filled with the scent of cinnamon and nutmeg. Inside, they found a cozy space with cushions and draped fabrics. In the center sat Madame Mistletoe, a kindly enchantress with long red hair and twinkling green eyes.\n“Ah, welcome, dear girls! I’ve been expecting you,” Madame Mistletoe said with smile.\nHannah and Meghan blinked in surprise. “You have? How did you know?”\nMadame Mistletoe chuckled softly. “I see things that others might not. Now, let us unveil the mysteries of your Christmas fortune” she said, offering the sisters a warm goblet of mulled mistletoe wine.\nHannah and Meghan eagerly sat sipping the warming tonic while Madame Mistletoe gazed into her crystal bauble. The bauble sparkled with a magical glow, revealing flurried images of future adventures.\n“The crystal shows me visions of new friends and starry skies” Madame Mistletoe said, her voice filled with warmth. “Let laughter and friendship guide your way.”\n“But beware the snowmen, they are not always what they seem” added madame Mistletoe frostily.\nHannah and Meghan nodded, their excitement building. They thanked Madame Mistletoe and left the candlelit tent. It sounds like our adventure is just starting! the sisters agreed excitedly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo back\n\n\n\n\nThe chocolate stall\n\n\n\nThe candy cane bridge"

Suddenly, the snowmen came to life, pelting Hannah and Meghan with snowballs. The girls giggled as they tried to dodge the frosty onslaught, but they soon found themselves surrounded.\nJust as the sisters were about to be covered in a snowy blanket, a voice rang out, “Hold on there, frosty fellows! That’s no way to treat our friends.”\nHannah and Meghan turned to see a lively elf with a jingling hat and a satchel of jingle berries. It was Jingleberry, the cheerful guardian of the Jingle Bell Path.\nWith a swift wave of his jingling wand, Jingleberry cast a spell that made the snowmen break into laughter instead of launching snowballs. They danced and jingled around, transforming the icy battlefield into a winter wonderland of joy.\n“Phew, that was close! Thanks for saving us, Jingleberry,” Hannah exclaimed, grateful for her new elf friend.\nJingleberry grinned, “No problem at all! Us elves stick together, especially during the most jingling time of the year.\n“Where will this path take us, Jingleberry?” asked Meghan.\nWhy this is the way to Santa’s workshop, silly goose! teased Jingleberry.

They flew over the night-time forest towards to glowing lights and far-off singing from Santa’s workshop.\nOh look! said Jingleberry, pointing excitedly.

There are even some wild herds in the Antipodes, notably in the foothills of Cradle Mountain on the Island of Tasmania and the snowy slopes of Tierra del Fuego.\nAll of these branches were calved from the original herds found in the northern ranges of Lapland where they still number in their tens of thousands.\nLike all of Santa’s Christmas Unicorns, Tipsycake comes from this herd."

The sisters could see their thorny briar-stick arms and the anger in their coal black eyes.\nThe snowboys started to move towards the two girls and the elf. “Oh snowballs” donged Jingleberry. Hannah and Meghan were starting to feel nervous.\nJust then the glade was filled with the smell of chocolate biscuits and warm milk and the reassuring sound of sensible boots stomping through the night-time forest.\nFrom the trees emerged a rosy-cheeked woman dressed in a warm red coat. Her grey hair shimmered in the moonlight. “It’s Mrs Claus!” pealed Jingleberry, dancing excitedly in the snow.\n“Away with you, dirty stop-outs” roared with Mrs Claus with glee, brandishing a poker at the powdery snowboys. Their frosty faces melted into the shadows.\n“Oh darlings it’s good to meet you, I’m looking for Santa and his sleigh” explained Mrs Claus. “It’s Christmas eve but he can’t be found”. Can you help me search the night-time forest? Or perhaps we should go back to the stable to fetch Tipsycake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo back\n\n\n\n\nSanta's sleigh\n\n\n\nThe stable"
