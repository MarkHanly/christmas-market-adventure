As they approached the tent they noticed a sign that read, “Madame Mistletoe’s Magical Fortunes.”\nIntrigued, Hannah and Meghan entered the tent, where the air was filled with the scent of cinnamon and nutmeg. Inside, they found a cozy space with cushions and draped fabrics. In the center sat Madame Mistletoe, a kindly enchantress with long red hair and twinkling green eyes.\n“Ah, welcome, dear girls! I’ve been expecting you,” Madame Mistletoe said with smile.\nHannah and Meghan blinked in surprise. “You have? How did you know?”\nMadame Mistletoe chuckled softly. “I see things that others might not. Now, let us unveil the mysteries of your Christmas fortune” she said, offering the sisters a warm goblet of mulled mistletoe wine.\nHannah and Meghan eagerly sat sipping the warming tonic while Madame Mistletoe gazed into her crystal bauble. The bauble sparkled with a magical glow, revealing flurried images of future adventures.\n“The crystal shows me visions of new friends and starry skies” Madame Mistletoe said, her voice filled with warmth. “Let laughter and friendship guide your way.”\n“But beware the snowmen, they are not always what they seem” added madame Mistletoe frostily.\nHannah and Meghan nodded, their excitement building. They thanked Madame Mistletoe and left the candlelit tent.

Suddenly, the snowmen came to life, pelting Hannah and Meghan with snowballs. The girls giggled as they tried to dodge the frosty onslaught, but they soon found themselves surrounded.\nJust as the sisters were about to be covered in a snowy blanket, a voice rang out, “Hold on there, frosty fellows! That’s no way to treat our friends.”\nHannah and Meghan turned to see a lively elf with a jingling hat and a satchel of jingle berries. It was Jingleberry, the cheerful guardian of the Jingle Bell Path.\nWith a swift wave of his jingling wand, Jingleberry cast a spell that made the snowmen break into laughter instead of launching snowballs. They danced and jingled around, transforming the icy battlefield into a winter wonderland of joy.\n“Phew, that was close! Thanks for saving us, Jingleberry,” Hannah exclaimed, grateful for her new elf friend.\nJingleberry grinned, “No problem at all! Us elves stick together, especially during the most jingling time of the year.\n“Where will this path take us, Jingleberry?” asked Meghan.\nWhy this is the way to Santa’s workshop, silly goose! teased Jingleberry.

They flew over the night-time forest towards to glowing lights and far-off singing from Santa’s workshop.\nOh look! said Jingleberry, pointing excitedly.
