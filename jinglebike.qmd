"Don't worry Jingleberry" said Hannah, "Me and Meghan can help you mend your bicycle".

Laying in the snow was a little red bicycle with a sturdy frame and candycane handlebars. Th sisters helped Jingleberry to lift the bike out of the snow and mend the chain. Soon it was ready to go. 

Hannah and Meghan hopped onto the back of the jinglebike behind Jingleberry, and with a joyful jingle, they pedaled away through the night-time forest. 

It was hard work cycling through the snow and the girls soon got tired. "Let's give it a little lift, eh", suggested Jingleberry. With a jingle of his bell and a burst of twinkling lights, they lifted off the ground.

Cara and Jingleberry found themselves soaring through the night sky, the forest below transformed into a dazzling display of sparkling trees and glimmering snow.      

As they giggled and floated through the sky, the girls spotted Santa's workshop, where cheerful elves were busy wrapping presents and preparing for the big night. The lights twinkled like a million stars, and the sound of holiday cheer filled the air.

But there was something else catching their attention. In a clearing below, they saw a group of playful snowmen having a snowball fight. Each snowball sparkled with a different color, creating a dazzling display of winter magic.
